# Flower Forum

## Project Description
This project is a full-stack application with a frontend built using **React, Vite, and ShadCN**, and a backend powered by two interchangeable server options: one built with **Express.js and MongoDB**, and the other with **NestJS and PostgreSQL**. This flexible setup ensures scalability and adaptability for varying deployment needs. The forum is designed for gardening enthusiasts, enabling seamless discussions about flowers, plants, and all things related to gardening.

The Flower Forum allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can view other profiles along with their threads and posts, create or participate in discussions, and interact with content through likes and comments.

## Frontend
### Tech Stack
- **React**: Core library for building the user interface.
- **ShadCN**: UI components built on Radix UI and styled with TailwindCSS.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
- **Cloudinary**: Handles image upload and management.
- **React Hook Form & Zod**: Form handling and schema-based validation.
- **React Toastify**: Toast notifications for user feedback.
- **Emoji Picker**: Adds emoji support to text fields.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainable code.


## Backend Compatibility
This frontend is designed to work seamlessly with the backend server built using ``Express.js + MongoDB`` or ``NestJS + PostgreSQL``.

âœ… **Ensure the backend server is configured and running before testing the full application.**
